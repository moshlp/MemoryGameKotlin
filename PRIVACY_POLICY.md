DondePedimos: Privacy policy
Welcome to the DondePedimos app for Android!

This is an open source Android app developed by Damian Peron. The source code is available on GitHub under the MIT license; the app is also available on Google Play.

As an experienced Android developer I take security and privacy very at heart.

This app collects only client's phone number and email address in order to provide a safe user experience and eliminate the use of bots to create calls to services, not any other personally identifiable information. All data (app preferences (like theme, etc.) and alarms) created is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
Damian Peron
